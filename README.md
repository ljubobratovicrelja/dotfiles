# dotfiles

Personal dotfiles, containing mainly vim data.

## .vimrc
I'm novice at vim, I doubt my .vimrc would be of use to anybody else.

## .vim/plugins
These are some of plugins I've written in vimscript to ease my workflow.

* **cmake.vim** - used to manage and build cmake projects from vim. All existing cmake plugins seemed overly complicated, and I've also found an excuse to learn vimscript. :)
* **cpp.vim** - set of workflow functions to ease c++ development. Still heavilly in development stage.
